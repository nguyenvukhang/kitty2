### Reporting bugs

Please first search existing bug reports (especially closed ones) for a report
that matches your issue.

When reporting a bug, provide full details of your environment, that means, at
a minimum, alatty version, OS and OS version, alatty config (ideally a minimal
config to reproduce the issue with).

Note that bugs and feature requests are often closed quickly as they are either
fixed or deemed wontfix/invalid. In my experience, this is the only scalable way to
manage a bug tracker. Feel free to continue to post to a closed bug report
if you would like to discuss the issue further. Being closed does not mean you
will not get any more responses.

### Contributing code

Install [the dependencies](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/alatty/build/#dependencies)
using your favorite package manager. Build and run alatty [from
source](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/alatty/build/#install-and-run-from-source).

Make a fork, submit your Pull Request. If it's a large/controversial change, open an issue
beforehand to discuss it, so that you don't waste your time making a pull
request that gets rejected.

If the code you are submitting is reasonably easily testable, please contribute
tests as well (see the `alatty_tests/` sub-directory for existing tests, which
can be run with `./test.py`).

That's it.
